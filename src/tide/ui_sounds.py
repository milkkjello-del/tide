"""UI sound dispatcher — clicks, modal pops, toggle chirps.

A single ``UiSoundPlayer`` instance owns paths to known sound files. Call
sites do ``window.ui_sounds.play("nav")`` — the dispatch is short-circuited
when the master toggle is off, when music is playing (set via ``set_muted``),
or when the key has no WAV registered.

WAVs live in ``tide/sounds/`` inside the package and ship with the wheel.
The loader is lenient: any missing file silently disables that key, so the
feature degrades cleanly on a fresh checkout where the user hasn't
authored every sound yet.

Music-playing detection: ``app.py`` connects the playback router's
``state_changed`` signal to ``set_muted(state == PlayState.PLAYING)``,
so UI sounds reappear automatically the moment playback pauses / ends.
