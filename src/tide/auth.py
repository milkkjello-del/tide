"""Authentication for YouTube Music.

We use **browser-cookie auth** as the primary path. YouTube's API regressed
the OAuth (TV-device) flow against music.youtube.com search endpoints in
mid-2024, returning HTTP 400 for WEB_REMIX requests with Bearer tokens.
Browser-cookie auth remains the reliable path.

To stay GUI-only (no config-file digging), the sign-in wizard embeds a
QtWebEngineView pointed at music.youtube.com. The user logs in normally;
we harvest cookies from the webview profile and write a ytmusicapi-compatible
headers dict to ~/.config/tide/browser.json.
