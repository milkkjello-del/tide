"""Stream-URL prefetch.

Most of the perceived "loading" gap between clicking next and hearing audio
in tide is the source's ``resolve_stream`` call — typically a yt-dlp /
ytmusic network round-trip costing 0.5–2 seconds. The mpv buffer is usually
under a second. If we can resolve the next track's URL while the current
one is still playing, ``_play_track`` finds a cache hit and goes straight
to ``player.load_ref``, skipping the worker entirely.

Design:
  * In-memory cache keyed by ``track.video_id`` → ``(StreamRef, expires_at)``.
    yt-dlp URLs typically last several hours, so a ~1h TTL is conservative.
  * In-flight dedupe via a small set so requesting the same track twice
    (e.g. the position tick fires every second past the threshold) doesn't
    spawn a second worker.
  * Silent failure mode. If a resolve raises, the entry is simply not cached
    and ``_play_track``'s normal path takes over with a fresh worker. There
    is no failure mode that's worse than today's behavior.
  * Lives on the GUI thread. The worker QThreads it spawns do the actual
    network work; their completion signals marshal results back via Qt's
    signal/slot queuing.
