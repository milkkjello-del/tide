"""PlaybackBackend abstraction.

A backend handles audio for one or more sources. v1.2.0 ships ``MpvBackend``
only (used by all 5 zero-DRM sources). v1.2.1 adds ``LibrespotBackend`` for
Spotify; v1.2.2 adds ``MusicKitBackend`` for Apple Music.

Backends expose the same signal surface as `tide.player.Player` so the
`PlaybackRouter` can re-emit transparently and existing window wiring keeps
working.
