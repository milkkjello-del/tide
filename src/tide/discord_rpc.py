"""Discord Rich Presence integration.

Off by default — to enable, the user provides a Discord Application Client ID
in Settings → Discord (or via the DISCORD_APP_ID env var). They get one in
~30 seconds at https://discord.com/developers/applications: New Application →
copy "Application ID" from General Information.

Why not bundle a default ID? Discord apps are namespaced by their owner. The
app's name + uploaded image assets are what Discord shows. Anyone using a
"tide-default" ID would see whatever assets that account uploaded, which
isn't a great trust story. Owning your own ID is also why the icon you see
in Discord can be your own album-art artwork instead of a stock glyph.

Failures are non-fatal. If Discord isn't running, we wait and try again. If
pypresence raises, we log and move on — the app keeps working.
