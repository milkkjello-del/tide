"""Headless current-lyric tracker.

Feeds "the line under the playhead right now" to non-UI consumers —
today that's Discord rich presence (live synced lyric in the status).
The lyrics *panel* (ui/lyrics.py) can't serve this role: it only tracks
the active line while it's the visible view, so a presence wired to it
would freeze the moment the user switches tabs.

Fetching mirrors the panel's provider chain (track's own source first,
LRClib as the community fallback), and lyrics_provider's on-disk cache
means an open lyrics panel + this tracker cost one network fetch, not
two.

Emissions: ``lyric_changed(str | None)``. None means "no current line" —
pre-first-line intro, instrumental gap (empty LRC line), untimed/missing
lyrics, disabled, or no track — so consumers can fall back to whatever
they normally display.
