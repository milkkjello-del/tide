# Changelog

All notable changes to **tide** land here. Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are [semver-ish](https://semver.org/) with a 4-segment patch when a release ships polish on top of an already-tagged feature drop.

The canonical source of truth for the diff lives in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/captiencelovesarch/tide/releases) — this file is for browsing history at a glance.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-07-02 — security hardening + live lyrics + bug fixes

Supersedes the never-released 1.2.3.2. A full security pass (world-readable credential fix, art-fetch SSRF/local-file-read guard, mpv protocol allowlist, Subsonic cleartext-password enforcement, and remote-metadata UI-injection hardening) lands alongside live synced lyrics in Discord Rich Presence, the app-wide adaptive backdrop, browser-free YouTube Music playback, and the rest of the accuracy/robustness fixes below.

### Added
- **Living adaptive backdrop** — the main app surface can now breathe with album-derived color: local-painted adaptive styles drift behind transparent structural views and swell on bass without driving per-frame `setStyleSheet()` calls. Styles include layered fields, the classic diagonal sweep, and a bottom-edge hill that swells into a filled arch on bass.
- **Bass pulse feed sharing** — the visualizer and ambient backdrop share the same reference-counted audio capture feed, so opening/closing the visualizer no longer tears down the app-wide pulse.
- **Live lyric in Discord presence** — opt-in toggle under Settings → discord: when the playing track has synced lyrics, the presence state line swaps artist · album for the line under the playhead (`♪ like this`), reverting during intros, instrumental gaps, and untimed tracks. A headless tracker (not the lyrics panel) drives it, so it keeps working with the panel closed, and it reuses the panel's provider chain + on-disk cache — one fetch per track, not two. Lyric pushes get their own wider throttle spacing (4.5 s) so sustained line traffic stays inside Discord's ~5-writes-per-20 s budget — dense verses skip ahead to the newest line rather than queueing a backlog — and an urgent pause/skip write still preempts a pending lyric push. Off by default: lyrics are broadcast to everyone who can see your profile.

### Security
- **Cache & data directories are now owner-only (0700).** `ensure_dirs()` hardened only the config dir; the cache and data trees were left world-traversable at 0755. The librespot subprocess writes a reusable Spotify session credential (`credentials.json`) under the cache dir at its own 0644, so on any system with a group-readable home a co-user could lift it. All three top-level state roots are now chmod 0700 — a directory boundary that holds regardless of whether an individual writer remembers to tighten its own files.
- **Album-art fetches are restricted to http(s) and size-bounded.** Thumbnail URLs come straight from third-party server JSON, and both art-fetch paths handed them to Qt's `QNetworkAccessManager` unchecked — which natively speaks `file://`, `data:`, and `ftp://`. A malicious/MITM'd source could return `file:///home/you/.ssh/id_rsa` (local-file read) or `http://169.254.169.254/…` (blind SSRF to internal hosts). Fetches now reject any non-http(s) scheme before touching the network, enforce a transfer timeout, and abort mid-stream past an 8 MB ceiling so a giant/slow body can't exhaust memory. The disk write also moved to a temp-plus-atomic-replace so a pre-planted symlink at the cache path can't redirect the write.
- **Media playback rejects mpv meta-protocols.** Resolved stream targets now pass a scheme allowlist (http/https/file/bare local path) before reaching libmpv, so a hostile source or extractor can't hand back `edl://`, `lavfi://`, `memory://`, `av://`, etc. to make the player read or compose local files.
- **Subsonic never sends your password in cleartext over HTTP.** "Plain password (https only)" was only a label — nothing enforced it, so `plain` auth against an `http://` server transmitted the password in the query string. The transmission point now silently falls back to the salt+token scheme whenever the connection isn't HTTPS, so the cleartext password never crosses an unencrypted link (and never lands in server access logs).
- **Update-check links are constrained to real GitHub URLs.** The release `html_url` from the GitHub API fed straight into `QDesktopServices.openUrl`; it's now allowlisted to `https://github.com/…` at both the parse site and the click site, so an unexpected `javascript:`/off-platform value can't be opened.
- **YT auth files no longer flicker world-readable.** `browser.json` and the derived `yt_cookies.txt` were written at the umask default and chmod'd to 0600 afterward, leaving a brief 0644 window. They're now created 0600 up front via a temp-plus-atomic-replace helper.
- **Remote metadata can't inject markup into the UI.** `QLabel` defaults to AutoText, which renders anything tag-like as HTML — so a crafted album/artist description, lyric line, track title, or server error message could inject rich text or a `file://` image probe into the app. Every label that displays remote strings (album/artist headers and descriptions, the timed- and plain-lyrics views, the lyrics/up-next/toast text) is now forced to `PlainText`, so remote content always shows literally. (The karaoke view already escaped and was unaffected.)
- **Hardened response parsing against hostile/malformed servers.** Duration/count fields are coerced through a non-raising `safe_int` (a non-numeric or >4300-digit value previously raised `ValueError` and tore down the worker thread), Subsonic responses of the wrong JSON *shape* are rejected instead of crashing on `.get()`, `parse_lrc` skips absurd timestamps rather than aborting the whole parse, poisoned lyric caches degrade to a miss, and every remote JSON read is byte-capped so a multi-GB body can't OOM the app.

### Fixed
- **Expired YouTube Music cookies now announce themselves** — imported cookies die quietly: YouTube starts answering 401 and every layer above either showed a generic error or swallowed it and rendered empty (home → generic shelves, library → nothing), so expiry looked like random breakage until you guessed "re-import cookies". Every ytmusicapi call now runs through an auth sentinel that recognizes auth-shaped failures (HTTP 401 / "authentication credential"), flips the source to *session expired* (warn dot + honest status in Sources), and raises one sticky toast with a **[sign in]** action that opens the import wizard in place — sign back in and home/library reload on the spot. A cheap background probe at launch means a dead jar is reported seconds after startup, not whenever you next touch search. Network blips are never misread as expiry, and playback keeps its anonymous fallback while you decide.
- **Discord presence tracks slowed/sped playback** — the progress bar is drawn by Discord in real wall-clock time, but the `end` timestamp was always `start + duration`, assuming 1× speed. Play a track at 0.5× and the bar raced to the end in half the real time (and 2× overshot). The player now publishes a `speed_changed` signal; presence scales `end` to `start + duration / speed` and re-anchors `start` to the live position on every speed change, so a 4:00 song at 0.5× correctly reads as an 8:00 bar that stays in lockstep with the audio.
- **Presence reliably stops on pause / skip** — Discord silently drops presence writes past ~5 per 20 s, so a quick play→pause or a rapid skip could lose the *clear*, stranding a stale "playing …" on your profile. All pushes now funnel through a trailing-edge throttle (`MIN_PUSH_INTERVAL_S`) that always sends the **latest** desired state, so the final pause/clear can never be the write that gets swallowed.
- **YouTube Music plays without a browser open** — stream resolution ran yt-dlp **anonymously**, which is what trips "sign in to confirm you're not a bot" / age-gates and made playback feel like it needed a logged-in `music.youtube.com` tab. yt-dlp now authenticates from the cookies already harvested at sign-in (a Netscape cookie jar derived from `browser.json`, regenerated only when that file changes), so playback is self-sufficient with no browser running — and unlocks higher-bitrate formats. Falls back to an anonymous resolve if the cookies are stale, so a bad jar is never worse than none.
- **Adaptive colors stay faithful to album art** — palette picking now chooses dominant hue families by real pixel mass before boosting readability, so green/grey covers do not turn yellow/pink because of tiny bright details.
- **UI sounds no longer crash startup on fragile QtMultimedia stacks** — sound effects now dispatch through the system WAV player (`pw-play` / `paplay` / `aplay`) instead of constructing `QSoundEffect`, avoiding a native PipeWire/QtMultimedia segfault seen before the main window opened.
- **UI sounds actually ship in installed builds** — the six WAVs lived in repo-root `assets/sounds/`, which the wheel never packaged, so every pacman/pip install had silently dead UI sounds. They now live inside the package (`tide/sounds/`) and are included in the build; the sdist also carries the desktop file and icons it needs so a wheel built from the published tarball keeps its desktop integration.
- **Radio can't dead-end anymore** — answering a refill request with `disable_radio()` (which the app does when the active source has no radio capability) stranded the one-shot refill guard, so radio never refilled again for the rest of the session even after switching back to a capable source. The guard now always clears.
- **Removing the playing track behaves like skip** — deleting the current queue row left the audio playing the removed track while the highlight moved on, and the next advance skipped a song. Removal now plays the track that took the slot (or stops when there's nothing after it), keeping audio, highlight, and advance in agreement.
- **Slow responses can't overwrite fast ones** — searching twice quickly could interleave both result sets into one list (the slower query appended after the faster one landed), and opening playlist B while playlist A was still loading let A repaint the pane afterwards. Search and playlist-detail responses now carry a request generation and stragglers from abandoned requests are dropped.
- **Spotify no longer stalls boot or vanishes offline** — startup did a blocking token refresh on the GUI thread (up to 15 s on a dead network) and dropped the source entirely if it failed. The source now registers from the stored grant with zero network and refreshes lazily on first use. Token refreshes are serialized under a lock (Spotify rotates refresh tokens, so concurrent refreshes burned them), network failures back off instead of hammering, and a revoked grant (`invalid_grant`) flips the row to *session expired* with the same sticky sign-in toast YT Music uses.
- **Spotify library shows more than 10 playlists** — the dev-mode result cap was applied as a total instead of a page size; the library list now paginates through your whole playlist collection in capped pages.
- **Source panel can't freeze on Spotify status** — the status line fetched your Spotify profile over the network on every repaint of the sources view, on the GUI thread, and a failed fetch retried on each call. Profile lookups now run in the panel's background prober (like Subsonic's ping), failures are negative-cached, and the repaint path never touches the network.
- **Subsonic failures are honest** — search/library/playlist errors used to be swallowed into "no results" / empty views while the panel kept claiming "signed in". Errors now surface in the UI, the row's health flips on transport/credential failures (and heals on the next successful call), and a per-request error like *not found* no longer poisons the whole source.
- **Stale prefetched stream URLs don't replay failures** — when mpv errored on a pre-resolved URL (expired CDN signature), the dead URL stayed in the prefetch cache and each retry replayed it. Player errors now evict the current track's prefetch entry so the next attempt resolves fresh.
- **Visualizer/ambient capture survives audio-server hiccups** — if `parec` exited (sink unplugged, PipeWire restart), the FFT loop spun forever on a dead pipe with the child unreaped, leaving the visualizer permanently dark. The capture now detects the death, respawns up to three times, and surfaces an error if it keeps dying. The shared capture is also force-stopped at quit, so an orphaned `parec` can no longer outlive tide and hold your monitor stream open.
- **Local search accepts quotes** — a query containing `"` (e.g. `12" remix`) broke the FTS5 MATCH string and errored the whole search; embedded quotes are now escaped.
- **Explore rows and onboarding cards stop leaking theme connections** — two widgets connected lambdas to the app-lifetime theme signal, which never disconnects; every discarded row kept a callback firing into freed Qt objects on later theme changes. Both use bound methods now, which auto-disconnect on destruction.
- **Karaoke / synced lyrics finally match the audio** — timed lyrics always came from LRClib, matched by title/artist text, so the sync frequently belonged to a *different recording* (album cut vs music video vs remaster) and the highlight drifted seconds off the song. YouTube Music's own line-synced lyrics — authored against the exact video being played — are now fetched first and win whenever they exist; LRClib stays as the fallback for tracks YT hasn't synced. (Implementation quirk: YT only serves timestamps to mobile clients and 400s the mobile context under signed-in browser cookies, so a dedicated anonymous client does the timed fetch.)

### Security
- **Subsonic credentials no longer persist to disk in URLs** — stream URLs embed the auth token (or, in *plain* mode, the actual password) in the query string, and the stream cache wrote them world-readable to `~/.cache/tide/streams/subsonic.json`, where they survived sign-out — a standing credential for any local reader, since Subsonic tokens never expire. Subsonic URLs are now built fresh per request and never cached; the stream-cache directory/files are 0600/0700; any previously persisted file is purged on startup, sign-out, and reconfiguration; and settings/session/history writes were tightened to 0600 with atomic, crash-safe replacement (settings additionally keep a last-known-good `.bak` so power loss can't reset you to onboarding).

### Changed
- **Visualizer rendering is capped and cheaper** — oscilloscope repaints are timer-capped, rendered through a bounded offscreen buffer, and decimated to roughly one point per pixel. Added a fast envelope renderer for large/HiDPI windows.

## [1.2.3.1] — 2026-06-30 — bug fixes

Pure bug-fix patch on top of 1.2.3 — no new surface, just things that were quietly wrong. The headline is YouTube Music personalization: the home feed served the generic logged-out shelves and the library came up empty even while signed in.

### Fixed
- **YouTube Music home is personalized again** — `browser_import` was merging `.google.com` *and* `.youtube.com` cookies into one flat header and deduping by name across domains. The auth cookies (`SID`, `__Secure-3PSID`, `SAPISID`, `__Secure-3PAPISID`) exist on **both** domains with **different** values, so wrong-domain values reached `music.youtube.com` and YouTube treated every request as logged-out (`LOGGED_IN:false`) — search still worked only because it needs no auth, which masked the bug. Now imports only `youtube.com`-scoped cookies, exactly what a browser sends to `music.youtube.com`. Personalized shelves (Quick picks, Listen again, Mixed for you, …) and library are restored.
- **YouTube Music sign-out actually signs out** — `YTMusicSource` inherited the base no-op `sign_out()`, so the Sources-tab button never cleared the saved cookie and the row kept saying "signed in". It now clears the cookie and flips the row state.
- **In-app re-sign-in** — the source gear dialog showed no button at all for a signed-out auth source, so signing out stranded YouTube Music until a restart. Added a `[sign in]` button (and `begin_auth()`) that re-runs the import wizard and refreshes the live client in place — no restart.
- **Auth no longer self-destructs on a network blip** — `ensure_signed_in()` deleted the saved cookies on *any* exception while building the client (which makes a network call), silently signing the user out. Transient failures now leave the saved session intact.
- **Album art honors rounded corners** — QSS `border-radius` never clips a `QLabel` pixmap, and `AlbumArt` read the theme's base `layout.radius_px` instead of the effective corner-style radius, so the art stayed square inside a rounded border. The pixmap is now masked to `theming.effective_radius_px()`. Sharp themes and the circle/polaroid variants are unchanged.
- **Settings stop resetting on save** — the settings dialog rebuilt its working copy field-by-field and silently dropped 16 fields (`ui_sounds_enabled`, `sources_enabled`, Spotify/Subsonic credentials, `audio_fx_state`, `first_launch_complete`, …), resetting them to defaults every time you hit save. It now deep-copies the whole settings object.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-06-16 — ui sounds + crossfading views

Tide gets a sense of touch. Short percussive sounds when switching nav views, soft pops on modal open/close, chirps on checkbox/radio toggles — all six WAVs hand-authored, all ship in `assets/sounds/`. The sounds auto-mute the second music starts playing so they never compete with the audio you're actually listening to. View switches also crossfade now using the same motion helper the onboarding wizard already used. Defaults to **off** on first launch — opt in via Settings → appearance → "ui sounds".

### Added
- **UI sound dispatcher** — `tide.ui_sounds.UiSoundPlayer`: one `QSoundEffect` per WAV key, played via `play("nav")` / `play("modal_open")` etc. Volume capped at 20 % of system so clicks never startle.
- **Six bundled sounds** — `nav` / `back` (view switch + back), `modal_open` / `modal_close` (dialogs), `toggle_on` / `toggle_off` (checkbox + radio flips).
- **Auto-mute during playback** — listens to the playback router's `state_changed`; flips muted on `PlayState.PLAYING` and back off the instant the player pauses or stops. Reseeds from the live player state on app start so resume-from-paused-session stays silent or not as appropriate.
- **Crossfading view transitions** — `_switch_view`, `_push_view`, and `_go_back` route through `tide.ui.motion.crossfade_stack` with `DUR_SHORT` (200 ms). Motion intensity `off` falls through to a direct `setCurrentIndex` automatically — same path the onboarding wizard already used between steps.
- **Settings toggle** — new "ui sounds" row under "motion:" in the appearance form. Hot-applied on save (no restart). Default `False` so a fresh install is silent.

### Technical
- `assets/sounds/` directory + `README.md` author spec — WAV format target documented for future contributors.
- Missing WAVs degrade cleanly — the loader treats every key as optional, so a fresh checkout without files just plays silence per key.
- Toggle hookups live in `_on_master_toggle` / `_on_loudness` / `_on_compressor` / `_on_mono` (audio fx view) and `_on_row_enable` / `_on_federate_toggle` (source panel). Future toggles add one `self._ui_sound(...)` line to the same handler.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-06-16 — audio fx rack

The "slowed + reverb" aesthetic finally has the reverb. v1.2.2 ships a full audio-FX rack riding on top of the existing mpv playback path — a 10-band graphic EQ, a five-preset reverb (off / room / hall / cathedral / signature **slowed**), bass + treble shelves, loudness normalization for queue sanity, stereo width, a level-boost compressor, and a mono fold. Everything composes with the existing speed + pitch-correction controls because mpv layers its scaletempo around our user filter graph. Works across every source — YT Music, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Mixcloud, Local, Subsonic — anything that resolves to a stream mpv plays.

### Added
- **`[audio fx]` panel** — new top-level view at `Ctrl+9`. 10 vertical EQ sliders (32 Hz → 16 kHz, ±12 dB, half-octave width). EQ preset cards (flat / bass boost / treble boost / vocal boost / v-shape / soft warmth). Reverb preset picker + wet slider. Bass + treble shelves. Loudness-norm / compressor / mono toggles. Stereo-width slider. Three user-saved EQ slots (`[save] [load] [clear]`).
- **Quick `[fx]` popover** — new now-playing-strip button (next to `[speed]`). Master enable, preset chooser, reverb chooser, bass + treble shelves. Right-click the button toggles the whole rack on/off without opening the popover.
- **Signature "slowed" reverb preset** — three-tap `aecho` chain tuned for the slowed-and-reverb vibe. Pair with playback speed 0.85× + pitch-correction off for the canonical tide sound.
- **Loudness normalization** — `loudnorm=I=-14:LRA=11:tp=-1.5` (the streaming-platform target) gives consistent perceived volume across queue tracks regardless of source mastering.
- **Persisted state** — full rack (master + EQ bands + every knob + custom slots) round-trips through `~/.config/tide/settings.toml` as a single `audio_fx_state` JSON string. Debounced saves (250 ms) so EQ-slider drag doesn't write the file 60 times a second.
- **Settings dialog `audio fx` section** — short explainer + `[open audio fx panel →]` jump.

### Technical
- New `tide/audio_fx.py` module — pure-Python `AudioFxState` dataclass + `build_filter_chain(state) → str` (renders mpv `af` chain in fixed order: EQ → bass → treble → stereo → compressor → reverb → loudnorm → mono). No Qt dependency.
- New `Player.set_audio_filter_chain(chain)` writes the mpv `af` property; rejection (unparseable filter string) leaves the previous chain intact and logs to stderr instead of crashing.
- `PlaybackBackend` default no-op + `PlaybackRouter` fan-out — librespot / MusicKit ignore the chain since they own their audio rendering path.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-16 — spotify (shelved) + subsonic + wizard fix

The architecture for Spotify lands — six sources can register, the library and search surfaces work end-to-end, librespot runs as a Spotify Connect device, OAuth and credentials caching are wired. **But audio playback is broken upstream** and there's no client-side fix. Spotify rolled out a platform-security update on 2026-02-06 that refuses audio-decryption keys to librespot regardless of how it authenticates (`--access-token`, librespot's own `--enable-oauth`, cached credentials — all fail with `audio key error 0 1`). Tide ships the source so the code path is ready when (if) Spotify reopens or librespot upstream patches it, but enabling Spotify surfaces an explicit warning that playback won't work.

Subsonic is the silver lining of the same release. Self-hosted music — Navidrome, Airsonic, gonic, Funkwhale, the reference Subsonic server — all speak the same REST surface, and tide now streams audio straight from your server. Search + library + albums + artists + home shelves + starred-as-liked all wired through `search3` / `getAlbumList2` / `getArtist` / `getSimilarSongs2`. No platform broker, no rate limits, no shelf state — your server, your music.

### Added (functional)
- **Spotify source** — search (10-result cap, see below), library + playlists (Liked Songs first), like/save, lyrics via LRClib fallback. Registered after auth completes; appears last in the source panel.
- **Subsonic / Navidrome source** — full Subsonic API 1.16.1 client: search3 for songs/albums/artists, getPlaylists + getPlaylist for library, getAlbum / getArtist / getArtistInfo2 for detail pages, getAlbumList2 (newest / frequent / starred / random) for home shelves, getSimilarSongs2 → getRandomSongs as the radio fallback, star/unstar for likes. MD5(password + salt) auth by default (safe over HTTP); plain-password mode for HTTPS-only Navidrome installs. Audio streams via the `stream` endpoint straight into mpv — same playback path as YT Music / SoundCloud / Bandcamp.
- **Subsonic connect dialog** — onboarding wizard ships a [set up] card for Subsonic that opens a URL + user + password + auth-style form with a `[test connection]` button (ping runs on a background thread, returns "signed in as X" or "can't reach …"). Same dialog reachable from the source panel's gear icon for re-configure or sign-out.
- **Shelved-state warning** — toggling Spotify on (in the onboarding wizard or the source panel) surfaces a confirmation dialog explaining what works, what doesn't, and why. Defaults to "No".
- **OAuth-PKCE sign-in for Web API** — onboarding's source step shows Spotify; clicking it opens the browser to Spotify's auth page and tide listens on `127.0.0.1:8898` for the redirect. Refresh tokens AES-encrypted at `~/.config/tide/spotify.json`.
- **Librespot subprocess + Web API control plane** — librespot runs as a Spotify Connect device named `tide` with `--system-cache ~/.cache/tide/librespot/`. tide drives play/pause/seek/queue via Web API. The router auto-switches between MPV (everywhere else) and librespot mid-queue.

### Spotify Dev Mode caveats (all the new February 2026 walls)
Spotify rolled out a tightened "Development Mode" tier on 2026-02-06. Apps that haven't been granted Extended Quota Mode (an explicit app review at developer.spotify.com) hit four new walls:
- **Audio decryption refused** — `audio_key error 0 1` for every track, regardless of auth method. This is the blocker that shelved playback.
- **Search results capped at 10** per query — anything higher returns 400 "Invalid limit". tide caps at 10 so the UI never sees the error.
- **`/browse/*` endpoints are 403** (featured-playlists, new-releases, categories) — home shelves can't render. Spotify's source registers without the `home` capability.
- **Artist top-tracks + related-artists are 403** — artist detail and track-station radio can't fill. Spotify's source registers without the `radio` capability.

### Fixed
- **First-launch wizard segfault** — clicking the `[set up]` button on a source card or canceling a YT cookie / Local-files dialog was opening a modal QDialog directly inside the click emission. On PySide6 + Python 3.14, returning to the Python frame ref-dropped the dialog while the SignalManager frames were still live, and the `deleteChildren` walk corrupted the heap. The setup dialog is now deferred past the emission via `QTimer.singleShot(0)`, and the dialog instance is explicitly `deleteLater()`'d instead of relying on Python ref-drop. Same blockSignals guard on the cancel-path uncheck so a second toggled emission can't re-enter mid-cleanup.
- **Radio refill against unsupported sources** — `_on_radio_refill_requested` checked the active source's `radio` capability; if the source declares no radio (now true for Spotify), tide auto-disables the queue's radio flag instead of spinning a worker that 403s in a loop.
- **librespot stderr was swallowed** — subprocess used to `stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL`, which hid the `Unrecognized option` / `audio key error` / Connect-handshake details that took most of v1.2.1's debugging time to surface. Now stderr inherits tide's so librespot's logs land in the same stream.

## [1.2.0.1] — 2026-06-16 — pre-spotify glow-up

### Added
- **Animations** — a motion system (`off` / `lite` / `full`) gating the new track-change signature: title scramble-decodes left-to-right while the album art crossfades between covers, layered on top of the existing adaptive accent fade. Reduced-motion env hint clamps `full` to `lite`.
- **Playback speed** — pitch-shifting speed control from 0.5× to 2.0× with a popover (`−0.05` / `+0.05` / presets / reset) and keyboard shortcuts (`[`, `]`, `\`). Pitch-shifted by default for the slowed-and-reverb / nightcore vibe; settings has a "preserve pitch" toggle for audiobook use.
- **Stream-URL prefetch** — when the current track has ≤15s remaining, tide pre-resolves the next track's stream URL. Auto-advance is now ~instant on cache hit; falls back silently on miss.
- **UI scale** — `compact` / `normal` / `large` / `huge` presets cascade through every fixed-size widget (track row, album art, cards, album/artist covers, view margins).
- **Adaptive central-area gradient** — opt-in subtle vertical gradient on the main content area (theme `bg` → album-derived `bg_alt`) that retints per track.
- **Soft corners** — `sharp` / `soft` / `rounded` picker applies a sticky `@radius` override across inputs, scrollbars, and the central-area clip.
- **Loading indicator** — customizable status-bar progress for the resolve → buffer → playing window. Five styles: `off`, `numbers`, `blocks`, `dots`, `ascii`.
- **Themed nav icons** — three sets: bundled brutalist SVG line-art (recolored to the active theme's `fg`), classic mono glyphs, and emoji.
- **Bundled fonts** — IBM Plex Mono, JetBrains Mono, and Inter ship in the package. New font picker in Settings overrides any theme's typography (editable to accept arbitrary system family names).

### Fixed
- **Adaptive theme color picker** — was sorting palette candidates purely by HLS saturation, so a single bright pixel could steal the accent. Now weighted by `vibrancy × √frequency` and normalized into a readable lightness band against the theme background.
- **Skip button** — now stops audio the instant you press it instead of letting the previous track play for the 1–3s the resolve worker takes.
- **Discord RP elapsed timer** — used to anchor to "queue selected" instead of "audio actually started," inflating the displayed elapsed time by the entire resolve+buffer window. Now anchors to `PlayState.PLAYING` via `now − player.position`; self-corrects for first-play, resume-from-pause, and reconnect-mid-song. Source label ("YouTube Music" etc.) now runs through `styled_case` so it tracks the active theme's typography.
- **Prefetch crash** — initial implementation held Python dict refs to the QThread that raced with Qt's `deleteLater` and segfaulted under PySide6. Now Qt-owned via `QThread(self)` with a clean `findChildren(QThread)`-based shutdown.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-16 — multi-source

tide is now a multi-source music client. A `MusicSource` ABC sits in front of every catalog; a `PlaybackRouter` dispatches audio to the producing source's declared backend.

- **5 sources at launch**: YouTube Music, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Mixcloud, Local Files (mutagen + SQLite FTS5)
- **`[source]` panel** (Ctrl+8) — per-source enable + active-source + status dot + sub-dialog gear
- **Federated search** — runs every enabled source in parallel and tags each row with its source badge
- **Capability-aware UI** — library / explore / like / radio buttons adapt to what the active source supports
- **Per-source stream cache** — each source picks its own TTL
- **Source-aware Discord RP** — per-source asset keys for `large_image` / `small_image`
- v1.2.1 → Spotify (Librespot backend), v1.2.2 → Apple Music (MusicKit backend)

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-16

Three lag/glitch fixes from end-of-v1.1 testing.

- **Adaptive theme override leak** — switching themes while adaptive was on left the previous theme's accent + bg_alt stuck in place. Now clears on every explicit theme apply.
- **Adaptive feedback loop** — in-flight accent animation re-triggering itself when token overrides emitted `theme_changed` mid-frame. Now gates on base-slug change.
- **Settings dialog lag** — opening Settings with adaptive on fired apply_layout + apply_theme + palette extraction for every dropdown's initial `setCurrentIndex`. Now `blockSignals` on all pickers during populate.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-15 — QOL kitchen sink

Five milestones of polish, discovery, integration, marquee features, and customization landed in this drop.
